                            <h3>Open source</h3>

                            <p>Ubuntu has always been free to download, use and share. We believe in the power of open source software; Ubuntu could not exist without its worldwide community of voluntary developers.</p>

                            <h3>Accessible</h3>

                            <p>Computing is for everyone regardless of nationality, gender or disability. Ubuntu is fully translated into over 50 languages and includes essential assistive technologies.</p>

                            <h3>Available on the largest range of hardware, ever</h3>

                            <p>Canonical works closely with Dell, Lenovo and HP to certify that Ubuntu works on a wide range of their laptops and workstations. It means that a seamless Ubuntu experience is available out of the box with more hardware choice than ever.</p>

                            <p>And Ubuntu isn’t just for the desktop, it is used in data centres around the world powering every kind of server imaginable and is by far, the most popular operating system in the cloud.</p>

                            <p>Pop!_OS is an operating system for STEM and creative professionals who use their computer as a tool to discover and create. Unleash your potential on secure, reliable open source software. Based on your exceptional curiosity, we sense you have a lot of it.</p>

                            <h3>Auto-Tiling With Pop Shell</h3>

                            <p>Pop!_OS uses auto-tiling for the same reason that people hire assistants: Organizing your work is incredibly time-consuming. Sure, you could still move, resize, and arrange windows yourself, but why spend the time when your OS does it for you? Auto-tiling helps you be both organized and efficient, and is especially convenient on large displays.</p>

                            <h3>Workspaces</h3>

                            <p>Keep relevant content together and irrelevant content out of sight. When the clutter overwhelms you, just toss it onto another desktop. Problem solved.</p>

                            <h3>Keyboard Navigation</h3>

                            <p>Arm yourself with a dark-lord level of power at your fingertips. Use keyboard shortcuts to:</p>
                                
                            <ul>
                                <li>Move/resize windows</li>
                                <li>Search for anything</li>
                                <li>Launch applications</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Stacking</h3>

                            <p>Stack application windows atop one another like tabs in a web browser. Just remember to switch off of Steam when the boss walks in.</p>
